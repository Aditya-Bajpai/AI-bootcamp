    "Have you ever wondered how we process and learn information? For example, how does our body process information such that we are able to move our hands or legs? To put it simply, the brain will process information and then send out signals to the rest of the body to trigger certain muscle movements. These signals are transported through the nervous system. One of the main components of the nervous system are neuron cells. These cells work on a threshold basis which means that the signal will only be transferred from cells to cells if it is higher than a certain value or amount. As such, when we decide to move our hands, the signals from the brain will get transferred to the muscle in our hands and not the muscle in our legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "However, this only explains how we process information. How about the ability of humans to learn? For example, why do we know to stop at a red light or how to kick a ball? It is because we were trained to do so by looking at examples or how other people were doing it. Through these examples, we were able to learn and remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would it be great if computers were able to mimic the way humans process and learn information? With artificial neural network, this can be done! Artificial neural networks are able to process and 'learn' complex relationships within datasets. An illustration of a simple neural network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that we input data into the input layer. Data will be processed in the subsequent hidden layer(s) - we only show one hidden layer on the picture below, but it can be many layers. Each layer is made of multiple artificial neurons which apply functions to the data and pass it on to another hidden layer, finally ending with the output layer. "

    "Take for example a young basketball player who is learning to shoot a 3-point shot. If he shoots and he misses because the shot is too short, the basketball player will adjust and increase the strength of the next shot. If the next shot now is too far right of the basket, the player will again adjust his shot to shoot more towards the center. The player continues to do this until the shot is made. The player then remembers the exact strength and shot direction when shooting 3-point shots in future.\n",

    "This is similar to how neural networks are trained. First, the data is passed through the network and a predicted output is given. This is known as a forward propagation. The predicted output is then compared to the actual output of the data and the differences between the predicted and actual will be passed backwards through the model. During the backward pass, adjustments will be made within the model such that the differences between prediction output and actual output will be reduced. This is known as the backpropagation. After the adjustments are made, data will be passed through from the input layer again and another predicted output will be made. The new predicted output will be compared to the actual output again and the differences will be passed backwards through the model. More adjustments will be made within the model.\n",

    "Here is another example to help you understand neural networks better. You have been tasked to bake a cake for your father's birthday. You follow the basic cookbook and come up with a basic cake. As you want your cake to be the best cake anyone has eaten, you approach your mother for a taste test. Your mother replies that the cake is too sweet and slightly burnt. Thus, you try and adjust the amount of sugar and also the time the cake spent in the oven. Next, you will then bake another cake with your new recipe and baking time before doing another taste test with your mother. This continues until you get the perfect cake.\n",

For neural networks, if the categories are not numerical groups (for example, 1,2,3,4,etc) we have to perform label encoding (Remember doing this in an earlier notebook?) before doing one-hot encoding. Refer to the bonus section in the \"Supervised learning technique\" notebook for more information on one-hot encoding. You can also read this [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/) to find out more. We can use the to_categorical function from Keras to help us do so. Try the code below to label encode then one-hot encode the y_values."

    "Congrats! You have successfully learnt how to create an artificial neural network model and trained it. Artficial neural networks are extremely powerful tools that can be used on very large datasets. For example, if you have a couple of hundred columns/features and over 100000 data points, it may be beneficial to use artificial neural networks instead of other machine learning techniques. Just remember, there are no strict rules on the number of nodes in the hidden layer or the number of hidden layers. Experiment with different neural networks to see which one provides the best result for your dataset."
